## Description
I wanted to create a website for avid readers to search for new books to read and save them to their profile so that they can keep a list of books to purchase

## Table of contents
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Questions](#questions)
 
## Usage
You can search the name of different books. You need to log in or sign up first. Once logged in, search the name of a book. Press the button to save the book. In the nav bar, head to the See your books page to see your saved list. There, you can press the remove book button in your books page.
